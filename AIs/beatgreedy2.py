# With this template, 
# we are building an AI that will apply 
# combinatorial game theory tools against a greedy opponent.

# Unless you know what you are doing, 
# you should use this template with a very limited number of pieces of cheese, 
# as it is very demanding in terms of computations.

# The first thing you should do is copy this file (tp3.py) to the AIs folder of pyrat, example:
# cp -r ~/IntroToAI/session4/tp3.py ~/pyrat/AIs/

# A typical use would be:
# python pyrat.py -d 0 -md 0 -p 7 --rat AIs/tp3.py --python AIs/manh.py --nonsymmetric

# If enough computation time is allowed, 
# it is reasonable to grow the number of pieces of cheese up to around 15.
# For example:

# python pyrat.py -d 0 -md 0 -p 13 --rat AIs/tp3.py --python AIs/manh.py --synchronous --tests 100 --nodrawing --nonsymmetric

# In this example, we can obtain scores in the order of: "win_python": 0.07 "win_rat": 0.93
